# Lingver

[![](https://jitpack.io/v/YarikSOffice/lingver.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#YarikSOffice/lingver)

Lingver is a library to manage your application locale and language.
 
Once you set a desired locale, Lingver will enforce your application to provide correctly localized data via Resources class.

The library contains an implementation of the approach described in the following [blogpost](https://proandroiddev.com/change-language-programmatically-at-runtime-on-android-5e6bc15c758).

## Setup

The setup is pretty simple:

1. Initialize the library in Application.onCreate:

``` kotlin
Lingver.init(this, defaultLanguage)
```
See the sample app for more customization options.

2. Change a locale, for instance, from your setting screen:

``` kotlin
 Lingver.getInstance().setLocale(this, language)
```

Note that you need to update all already fetched locale-based data manually. Lingver is not responsible for that.
